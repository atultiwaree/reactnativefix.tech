## 💡 Why This Matters

React Native is great — until:

- builds stop working,
- crashes appear only in release,
- deprecated libraries break your workflows,
- store submissions get rejected,
- or SDKs behave inconsistently.

When that happens, most generic devs panic.  
I fix that.

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies I Use

- **React Native** (core + native modules)  
- **Xcode / Android Studio / CLI tooling**  
- **Crashlytics / Sentry / logs analysis**  
- **Payment SDKs (Stripe, Razorpay, etc.)**  
- **AI APIs (OpenAI, embeddings, PDF processing)**

This is not theoretical — it’s applied to *actual production apps*.
